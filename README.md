# RStudio-Black
Some customizations made to RStudio, mainly editor themes.

The built-in dark themes of RStudio were mostly deep blue instead of black. Inspired by [rscodeio](https://github.com/anthonynorth/rscodeio/), a few modificaitons was made to generated some tatally black themes. Colors of syntactic highlight was adopted from other built-in dark themes.

> Why black themes?
> 
> Because light attracts bugs.
